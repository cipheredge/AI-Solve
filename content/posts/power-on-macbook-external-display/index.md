Today I encountered a perplexing situation: my MacBook Air suddenly stopped providing a signal to the external display, but the built-in screen was still working. This has happened before – sometimes the external display works, sometimes it doesn't at all, and I haven't changed any settings during these times.

I started feeling confused and even a bit annoyed. As someone who frequently needs an external display for work, this randomly occurring issue really impacts efficiency. I checked the system settings, inspected the display connection – everything seemed normal, but it just wouldn't work.

Just as I was losing hope and preparing to restart the computer, I casually plugged in the power charging cable. Then a magical thing happened – the external display suddenly worked! This unexpected discovery surprised me and sparked my curiosity.

After some research, I discovered that this is actually a power management feature of the MacBook. When using battery power, the system adopts more aggressive energy-saving strategies. Especially when the battery is low or the system load is high, macOS may choose to turn off certain features to save power, including reducing support for external displays.

Once connected to a power source, since there's no longer a need to worry about battery life, the system switches to a higher-performance mode, which can then support both the built-in display and the external display working simultaneously.

This design is quite interesting; it reflects the balance Apple strikes between portability and performance. Although it may sometimes cause inconvenience, it's indeed a consideration for extending battery life.

If you also encounter a similar situation, here are a few suggestions:

1. When using an external display, try to connect to a power source.
2. When on battery power, you can adjust the energy settings in System Preferences, choosing a mode that leans more towards performance.
3. Pay attention to the battery level and charge promptly when the battery is low.

Additionally, if you encounter display issues, you can also try resetting the SMC (System Management Controller). The method is simple:
1. Shut down the computer.
2. Press and hold Control + Option + Shift for 10 seconds.
3. Continue holding these keys while also pressing the power button for 10 seconds.
4. Release all keys.
5. Press the power button to start the computer.

Hopefully, this discovery can help Mac users who encounter this problem. Sometimes what appears to be a malfunction may have its design considerations behind it, and understanding these can help us use our devices better.

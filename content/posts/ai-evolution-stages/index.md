You've probably heard about the recent viral news about Deekseek ðŸ”¥. From OpenAI's ChatGPT to Anthropic's Claude, and domestically to kimi, Doubao, Wenxin Yiyan, and Tongyi Qianwen, AI technology has been advancing rapidly. Even tech giants like Microsoft and Google, known for their steady approach, have joined this AI race. So, under this wave of enthusiasm, what are the development trends of the AI revolution?

As a new technological revolution, AI's development must go through a process from niche to mainstream. Just like personal computers and the internet in their early days, AI needs to follow a path of "popularization." I believe this process will be divided into three stages.

## Stage One: Price Popularization, Let Opinion Leaders Drive Adoption

Think back, when did you start paying attention to AI? Most likely, it started with a share from a blogger or a recommendation from a friend. This is the power of Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs). They are the first adopters of new technology and key to its spread.

For AI, price popularization is the first step. Take the recently viral [Deepseek](https://www.deepseek.com) for example; its free strategy has allowed many creators and tech enthusiasts to experience the charm of AI. The standouts among these people became the first wave of AI technology evangelists. Through short videos, blogs, and other means, they help more people understand AI's capabilities.

Imagine if AI services were all as expensive as the early GPT-4, who would risk trying them? Only when the price is low enough can it attract enough people to experiment, allowing the concept of AI to truly take root in people's minds.

## Stage Two: Functional Popularization, Let AI Truly Serve Production

Once everyone knows about AI, the next question arises: What can AI do?

This requires AI to have stronger connectivity. For instance, current AI can already control software through function calling and read various data sources through [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (Model Context Protocol). These features are like installing USB ports on AI, allowing it to connect to our work environment.

For example, suppose you're an accountant. Previously, when dealing with Excel spreadsheets, you needed to manually write formulas and design charts. Now with AI assistants, you just need to describe your requirements in natural language, and AI can help you complete these tasks. This change isn't just a gimmick; it's a real productivity boost.

## Stage Three: Performance Popularization, Let AI Serve the Broadest User Base

When price and functionality are no longer issues, the final challenge is performance. Current AI still has many limitations, such as "giving up" when processing long documents or "freezing" when generating images.

This stage requires progress in both software and hardware. Take technologies like MemGPT as an example; it simulates computer virtual memory mechanisms to allow AI to handle longer content. Although this technology isn't mature yet, it shows future possibilities.

## Summary: Productivity Enhancement is Fundamental

The core theme running through these three stages is the fundamental contradiction between AI's productivity boost and the cost of AI elements. Each stage addresses problems at different levels:

- Price popularization allows more people to access AI
- Functional popularization integrates AI into work
- Performance popularization makes the user experience smoother

This is like a pyramid, where each layer needs the next layer as its foundation. Only when all three aspects are improved can AI truly become a technological revolution that changes the world like personal computers and the internet did.

So, next time when you hear about an AI product or technology, think about which stage it's in. This way, you can better judge its development prospects and practical value.

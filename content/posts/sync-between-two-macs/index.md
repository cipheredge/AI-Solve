In the past, we used apps like QQ or WeChat to transfer files between devices. Now, on Mac, we can use the built-in **file transfer** feature.

## Steps

The process consists of three main steps: first, enabling file transfer on the sending Mac, second, connecting the receiving Mac to the sender's file transfer system, and third, copying files to begin the transfer.

### Enable Sharing on the Sending Mac
Open System Settings, go to File Sharing, enable File Sharing, enter your system password, and confirm to enable it.

### Connect the Receiving Mac to the Sender
On the sender's sharing interface that we just enabled, click the small "i" icon with a circle on the right, find the computer name, and copy it.

On the receiving Mac, open Finder, press Cmd+K shortcut simultaneously, paste the sender's computer name, and press Enter to confirm.

### Copy Files
After entering the sender Mac's account password or connecting anonymously, you can copy files in the opened window just like copying folders between local directories.

## Summary
Using Mac's built-in file transfer feature helps us quickly transfer data within a local network.

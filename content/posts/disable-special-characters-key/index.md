In macOS, by default, holding down the Option key and pressing any letter key will automatically trigger a special character popup. This feature isn't particularly useful for most of us and can actually interfere with the use of certain keyboard shortcuts. Let's look at how to disable this functionality.

## Steps

The process involves two main steps: first, disabling special characters in the English input method, and second, disabling them in the Chinese input method.

### English Input Method
Open System Settings, go to Keyboard, and edit input sources. Remove the default ABC English input method, then find and add "Unicode Hex Input" from the input sources list.

### Chinese Input Method
Here we'll focus on disabling this feature in Sogou Pinyin Input Method. Open Preferences, go to Keys -> Keyboard Layout, find and change it to Unicode Hexadecimal Input.

By switching the keyboard layout, we can prevent special characters from automatically popping up when using keyboard shortcuts.

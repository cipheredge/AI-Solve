## Dream

<!--more-->

- I have a dream that one day, rural children will have access to computers or tablets, connect to the internet, and use AI to immerse themselves in an ocean of knowledge, exploring and growing with their talents. Like urban children, they will be able to take important exams through the internet and AI, and like American children, they will have multiple attempts, keeping their best scores.
- I have a dream that one day, there will be no traditional farmers in rural areas. Children will have moved to cities. The countryside will only have production teams, cooperatives, and agricultural technology companies, where white-collar workers and tech talents work. People will use AI and programs to drive electrified equipment across the fields, harvesting abundant fruits, and famine will no longer exist in the world.
- I have a dream that one day, rural areas will become a new phenomenon, with mechanized equipment harvesting in the fields, scientists and technicians cultivating new crops in laboratories, and autonomous trucks transporting agricultural products between rural areas and cities. The countryside will no longer be synonymous with poverty but will become, like cities, prosperous agricultural industrial zones and beautiful tourist destinations.

## About This Blog

Science and technology are the primary productive forces. Throughout hundreds of thousands of years of human development, from the Stone Age to the establishment of agricultural civilization, it wasn't until modern times that we witnessed the tremendous changes brought by the Industrial Revolution. In just two hundred years, we've experienced the Steam Age, the Electrical Age, the Information Age, and now stand at the new starting point of Artificial Intelligence. Each technological breakthrough profoundly changes our modes of production and ways of life, driving massive societal transitions from rural to urban, from workshops to factories, from regional economies to globalization, writing new chapters in human civilization.

Practice has proven that when science and technology are mastered by peace-loving people, more individuals benefit, escaping poverty and achieving prosperity, thereby improving the economic foundation of families and communities, shaping a just society and even strong nations. To master science and technology, we need continuous practice, reflection, and learning. Only by transforming ideas in our minds into written words, recording them, and processing them can we advance this process.

Therefore, I am willing to share here my encounters with various problems and their solutions. Through open-source knowledge, I aim to help more people access software technology and artificial intelligence, familiarize themselves with relevant technical terms and professional concepts, guide more people to master technology, help improve work efficiency, and promote the application of science and technology in practical work and life. All this contributes to hastening the day when "machines completely replace humans in handling heavy physical tasks."

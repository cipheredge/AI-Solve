Replacing a MacBook battery can be expensive, typically costing between 1000-2000 RMB in China. Especially for users planning to resell their devices in the future, battery health directly impacts the resale value. However, with proper charging management, we can significantly extend battery life. That's why I want to introduce you to AlDente, a battery management tool.

## Why Manage Charging?

According to research from [Battery University](https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-808-how-to-prolong-lithium-based-batteries), lithium batteries have a characteristic: frequently keeping them at 100% charge or repeatedly fully charging and discharging between 0% and 100% accelerates battery aging. Reducing the charging voltage by just 0.1V can potentially double the battery's cycle life. The ideal usage range is between 20%-80%. It's like a water glass â€“ it's not good to always fill it to the brim or let it completely empty; keeping it at a moderate level is best.

## What is AlDente?

[AlDente](https://apphousekitchen.com/) is a charging management software specifically designed for MacBooks. It allows you to:
1. Control the charging limit, preventing the battery from always staying at 100%.
2. Flexibly adjust charging strategies based on usage scenarios.
3. Monitor battery health.

## Free vs Pro Version

### Core features provided by the free version:
- Setting a charging limit
- Active discharge function

### [Pro version](https://apphousekitchen.com/pricing) adds practical features:
- Temperature monitoring and protection
- Automatic calibration mode
- Scheduled tasks
- Detailed battery status monitoring
- More intelligent charging management options

## Who Should Buy the Pro Version?

Although the Pro version requires payment (approximately 210 RMB), it is worthwhile for the following user groups:

1. Heavy Users:
- Frequently need to work plugged in for extended periods.
- Have high demands for battery life.
- Plan to use the device for 3 years or more.

2. Professional Users:
- MacBook is the primary work tool.
- Device reliability directly impacts work.
- Replacing the battery or device would incur significant expenses.

## Usage Suggestions

1. Getting Started:
- First try the [free version](https://apphousekitchen.com/) to familiarize yourself with the basic functions.
- Set the charging limit to around 80%.
- Avoid letting the battery drop below 20%.

2. Advanced Usage:
- Set different charging strategies based on usage scenarios.
- Periodically allow the battery to complete a full charge and discharge cycle (once a month).
- Pay attention to checking the battery temperature.

## Saving Money Summary

Taking a scenario of using a MacBook for three years as an example:
- No charging management: May need to replace the battery (refer to [Apple official repair price](https://support.apple.com/mac/repair/service), 1000-2000 RMB).
- Using AlDente management: Pro version costs approximately 210 RMB.
- Potential savings: 800-1800 RMB.
- Additional benefits: Better value retention when reselling.

For ordinary users, the free version is actually sufficient. But if you are a heavy user or care a lot about device value retention, the Pro version is worth the investment.

Remember, good charging habits combined with the right tools can help you save a lot of money. Moreover, these investments will ultimately pay you back through longer battery life and better resale value.

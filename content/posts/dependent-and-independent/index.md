Many people view "dependence" and "independence" as opposing concepts, believing that a person must be either independent or dependent. However, this understanding is overly simplistic. Let's reexamine this seemingly contradictory pair of concepts through examples from everyday life.

## Starting with Infants

Let's begin by considering human development. A newborn infant appears to be completely dependent on their parents: requiring feeding, care, and protection. However, upon closer examination, many of the infant's physiological functions, such as breathing, digestion, and excretion, are entirely independent. No one can perform these basic life functions for the infant.

This reveals an interesting phenomenon: even during the period of greatest dependence on others, humans possess inherent independent characteristics that cannot be taken away.

## Are Adults Truly Independent?

Now let's look at supposedly "independent" adults. They can make autonomous decisions and live independently, appearing self-sufficient. However, in reality, an adult's life is inseparable from societal support:

- Work requires team collaboration
- Daily life needs support from various service industries
- Mental well-being requires nourishment from social interactions

This shows that even the most "independent" individuals cannot exist without connections to others.

## Why the Misunderstanding?

We often view dependence and independence as opposing concepts because we're accustomed to looking at issues from a single dimension. It's like viewing a three-dimensional object:
- From one angle, it appears circular
- From another angle, it appears square
- But the object itself is a cylinder

The relationship between dependence and independence is similar. They're not mutually exclusive choices, but rather manifestations of the same entity across different dimensions.

## Lessons from International Relations

This principle becomes even more evident in international relations. Taking China as an example:
- Maintains independence in sovereignty and development path
- Maintains close trade relations with various countries
- Advocates cooperation and mutual benefit in global issues

In this context, it's difficult to label China as either "dependent" or "independent" because both characteristics exist simultaneously in different domains.

## Insights from the Taiji Symbol

The Taiji (Yin-Yang) symbol from traditional Chinese culture provides an excellent reference. The seemingly opposing forces of yin and yang are actually interdependent and inseparable. Modern science tells us that the Taiji symbol actually describes temperature changes caused by Earth's movement:

- The alternation between cold and heat appears opposing
- But both originate from the unified process of Earth's rotation around the Sun

This discovery provides an important insight: seemingly opposing phenomena often stem from a deeper unified essence.

## Reunderstanding Dependence and Independence

Rather than viewing dependence and independence as opposing choices, we should understand them as:
- Different dimensions of the same entity
- Interdependent aspects
- Essential components of a unified whole

Like the two fish in the Taiji symbol, they appear opposite but actually generate and complete each other, together forming a complete whole.

## Implications for Us

This understanding has important practical implications for our lives:

1. We shouldn't feel ashamed of "depending" on others, as this is a natural expression of human social nature
2. We shouldn't obsessively pursue absolute "independence," as this might cause us to miss many opportunities for growth
3. What's important is finding appropriate balance points across different dimensions

Understanding this unified relationship between dependence and independence allows us to view our own and others' lifestyles with more inclusivity, and better handle various social relationships.

Ultimately, dependence and independence are not mutually exclusive choices, but rather a unified relationship that naturally formed during human social development. Understanding this allows us to maintain our independent character while better collaborating with others to achieve mutual development.

## From Transportation Tool to Living Space

When AI takes over the core task of driving, the car's interior space gets redefined:
- Seats are no longer constrained by driving position layout
- Interior design can focus more on comfort and functionality
- The car interior becomes a "second living room" for free use

This change transforms cars from tools that simply transport people from point A to B into mobile living spaces. Just as personal computers evolved from calculation tools to information platforms, future cars will become intelligent platforms supporting diverse life scenarios.

## Integration of Multiple Scenarios

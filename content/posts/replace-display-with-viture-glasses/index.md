Last week while I was in China, I was attracted to a pair of display glasses while browsing Taobao. To be honest, I'm not unfamiliar with such products â€” last year I tried a head-mounted device called Goovis, but returned it because it was too bulky. This time the seller offered a trial, so I decided to give it a try.

To my surprise, I was immediately impressed when I put them on.

## Real User Experience

Today I brought the glasses to my office in the UAE. As soon as I started working, my Kazakhstani colleague from next door was drawn over, asking if these were similar to Apple glasses. I explained that they were indeed similar but more lightweight and affordable. He immediately wanted to try them on, and kept nodding in approval after putting them on.

What's more interesting is that a passing colleague saw them and curiously asked if he could try them too. The moment he put them on, he exclaimed "holy shit" and immediately took out his notebook to write down the brand name. Clearly, I wasn't the only one impressed.

## Why Did I Decide to Keep Them?

What attracted me most about these glasses is how they completely changed my working posture. Previously, I would unconsciously hunch over the screen, but now I can completely relax against the chair back. The display follows your head movement, like watching a giant virtual screen, making it feel like working in a private theater.

What surprised me even more was that after using them for an entire day, I didn't feel any eye strain even while driving home. In fact, because I didn't have to maintain a fixed posture, my whole body felt much more relaxed.

## Mac Usage Tips

For Mac users, there's a small tip when using these glasses: remember to adjust the display mode to mirror display in system settings, and select viture as the primary display with its optimized options. This will give you better display results.

## My Thoughts

When recommending them to my Kazakhstani colleague, I shared a vision: perhaps in the future, everyone in the office will be working with such glasses, no longer confined to traditional working postures. Imagining that scene is quite cool. He smiled in agreement after hearing this.

Honestly, as a programmer who frequently faces computers, I think this could really change how many people work. If you're like me, troubled by office posture and neck issues, you might want to consider trying these Viture display glasses.

Finally, a friendly reminder: even the best tools should be used in moderation, remember to give your eyes appropriate rest. After all, health is the foundation of work.

"The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide." This ancient wisdom perfectly describes the chip market over the next two decades. Currently, we are at a crucial historical turning point: transitioning from the "Western Zhou" era of x86 dominance to a "Warring States" period of diverse coexistence. The core force driving this transformation is AI, the new era's "Mandate of Heaven."

## The "Warring States" of the Chip Market

### From Monopoly to Diverse Coexistence

Looking back, x86 architecture's dominance in personal computing and server domains seemed unshakeable. However, the situation has fundamentally changed:

- AMD's CPU market share has exceeded 90%
- ARM architecture dominates the mobile device sector
- NVIDIA leads in AI accelerators
- FPGA demonstrates unique value in specific scenarios

This diversification isn't coincidental but a necessary result of varied computing demands in the AI era. Just as different states developed unique governance models during the Warring States period, today's chip companies are finding their optimal development paths in their respective "territories."

### AI: The New Era's "Mandate of Heaven"

If the chip market's diversification is the surface phenomenon, AI is the underlying driving force. AI is reshaping the entire computing paradigm:

- Data centers need more powerful computing capabilities
- Edge devices require more efficient processing power
- Specific scenarios demand more flexible solutions

Like the "Mandate of Heaven" in the Zhou Dynasty, AI has become an entity that no one can monopolize, yet everyone must pay tribute to. Every chip manufacturer must consider how to better support AI while deriving their own development momentum from it.

## 2025-2026: The Dawn of AI Applications

### Standards Battle and Ecosystem Building

Several landmark events occurred in AI from late 2023 to early 2025:

- Continuous expansion of Context Window (64K→200K→2M)
- OpenAI's launch of multimodal large models (audio, image, text)
- Anthropic's introduction of MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- DeepSeek's demonstration of high-performance, low-cost models

These advances indicate AI's transition from "wild growth" to "standardized development." The emergence of the MCP protocol is particularly noteworthy, attempting to provide a unified interface standard for AI applications, similar to what USB did for hardware devices.

### 2025: Darkness Before Dawn

2025 might be a challenging year:

- Standards battles need time to settle
- Development ecosystems require gradual improvement
- Business models need market validation

But this "chaos" precisely indicates the industry is on the verge of major breakthroughs. Like the internet in 1994, infrastructure is gradually improving, but the killer app hasn't yet emerged.

### 2026: The Year of Application Explosion

As various foundational conditions mature, 2026 might become the year of AI application explosion:

- MCP ecosystem approaches maturity
- Development barriers significantly lower
- Vertical domain applications emerge

We might witness a landmark event similar to the 1995 Netscape moment, marking AI applications' official entry into the mass market.

## Twenty-Year Outlook

### Technology Evolution Trends

1. Computing Architecture Diversification:

   - Cloud: High-performance general computing
   - Edge: Low-power specialized processing
   - Scenario: Programmable flexible computing
2. Standardization and Openness:

   - Hardware interface standardization
   - Software ecosystem openness
   - Development tool democratization
3. Application Scenario Segmentation:

   - General computing continuous upgrade
   - Specialized acceleration widespread adoption
   - Scenario customization more prevalent

### Market Pattern Predictions

The future chip market will show "ordered competition":

- x86 and ARM each have advantages in different scenarios
- NVIDIA leads the AI accelerator market
- FPGA continues to deepen in specific domains
- New technology paths constantly emerge

This pattern isn't chaotic competition but ecological symbiosis, where each participant contributes unique value to the entire industry chain.

## Conclusion

Looking back from 2025, we are at an exciting historical moment. The chip industry's "Warring States" period isn't an endpoint but the beginning of a new era. Just as the Warring States period gave rise to the Hundred Schools of Thought, the current diversification will drive explosive growth in technological and application innovation.

In the next twenty years, we're likely to see:

- More diverse computing architectures
- More open technology ecosystems
- Richer application scenarios
- More accessible AI services

This is an era of both challenges and opportunities, but one thing is certain: under the guidance of AI as the "Mandate of Heaven," the industry's development direction is clear. The next task is to find our own position and value within this broader direction.

As history teaches us: after long division, comes unity. Today's "warlord chaos" will eventually give birth to tomorrow's new order. In this process, the real winners are the entire industry, technological progress, and the development of human civilization.

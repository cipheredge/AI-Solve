By default, macOS only allows users to open applications downloaded from the App Store or from other trusted publishers.

However, in practice, we often encounter software from third-party sources. So how do we open them?

## Steps

The process consists of three main steps: first, checking system settings; second, allowing the app to open; and third, opening and using the app.

### Check System Settings
Open System Settings, go to Security, and confirm that "App Store and identified developers" is selected.

### Allow Opening
Navigate to the target folder and double-click the file we want to open. A security warning will appear; click Cancel.

After this step, go back to System Settings, enter Security, and click "Open Anyway."

## Open and Use
Return to the target application and double-click to open it. This time you'll see a different security warning; select Open, and you can start using the app.

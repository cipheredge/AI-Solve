If you're like me, accustomed to WYSIWYG editors like WPS or Word, you might feel confused when first encountering Vim or LazyVim. This article will help you understand some basic concepts and, through analogies, help you master LazyVim more quickly.

## Basic Concept Comparison

Let's understand LazyVim's basic concepts through some analogies:

### Tabs and Windows
In Word, we usually open multiple documents that appear as tabs at the top of the window. In LazyVim, this concept is divided into two layers:
- **Tabs**: Similar to Word tabs, used to organize multiple workspaces
- **Buffers**: The form of opened files in memory, similar to Word's "Open Documents List"
- **Windows**: Areas that display content, a tab can be split into multiple windows, similar to Word's "Split View"

### What is the Leader Key?
In Word, many operations require pressing `Ctrl` or `Alt` with other keys. In LazyVim, the `Space` key is set as the "Leader key" - it's like a new `Ctrl` key used to trigger various commands. When you press the space key, a command menu appears showing available operations.

## Common Shortcut Guide

### File Operations
These operations might be your most frequently used:

- **Save File**: `Ctrl + s`
  - Just like `Ctrl + s` in Word
  
- **Open File Explorer**: `Space + e`
  - Similar to clicking the "Open File" button in Word
  
- **New File**: `Space + fn`
  - Equivalent to "New Document" in Word

### Tab Operations
If you're used to using multiple tabs in Word, these shortcuts will be useful:

- **Switch to Next Tab**: `Space + tab + ]`
  - Similar to `Ctrl + Tab` in Word
  
- **Switch to Previous Tab**: `Space + tab + [`
  - Similar to `Ctrl + Shift + Tab` in Word
  
- **New Tab**: `Space + tab + tab`
  - Similar to "New Window" in Word

### Buffer Operations
These operations might be hard to understand at first, but you'll soon discover their convenience:

- **Switch to Next File**: `Shift + l`
  - Switch between open files
  
- **Switch to Previous File**: `Shift + h`
  - Switch back through files
  
- **Close Current File**: `Space + bd`
  - Equivalent to "Close Document" in Word

### Editing Operations
Some basic editing operations:

- **Copy**: `y` (in visual mode)
  - Equivalent to `Ctrl + c`
  
- **Paste**: `p`
  - Equivalent to `Ctrl + v`
  
- **Undo**: `u`
  - Equivalent to `Ctrl + z`
  
- **Redo**: `Ctrl + r`
  - Equivalent to `Ctrl + y`

### Code Comments
While commenting is rarely needed in Word, it's commonly used in programming:

- **Comment Current Line**: `gcc`
- **Comment Selected Region**: `gc` (after selection)
- **Add Comment Below**: `gco`
- **Add Comment Above**: `gcO`

## Navigation and Search

### In-File Navigation
- **Move Down**: `j`
- **Move Up**: `k`
- **Move Left**: `h`
- **Move Right**: `l`

You might think, "This isn't intuitive at all!" But trust me, once you get used to this method, your fingers will never need to leave the main keyboard area.

### Search
- **Search in File**: `/` then type what you want to search
  - Similar to `Ctrl + f` in Word
- **Find Next**: `n`
- **Find Previous**: `N`

## Advanced Usage Tips

### Split Screen Operations
In LazyVim, you can split windows like splitting views in Word:

- **Horizontal Split**: `Space + -`
- **Vertical Split**: `Space + |`
- **Move Between Splits**:
  - `Ctrl + h` (left)
  - `Ctrl + j` (down)
  - `Ctrl + k` (up)
  - `Ctrl + l` (right)

### File Tree Operations
When you press `Space + e` to open the file explorer:

- Use `j`/`k` to move up/down
- Press `Enter` to open file
- Press `v` to open in vertical split
- Press `h` to open in horizontal split

## Some Tips

1. **Don't Fear Pressing Wrong Keys**
   - LazyVim has a good undo mechanism, press `u` to undo
   - If you're unsure what to do, press `Esc` to return to normal mode

2. **Make Good Use of Command Panel**
   - Press the space key and wait a moment to see available commands
   - It's like Word's ribbon, but operated by keyboard

3. **Progressive Learning**
   - Don't try to memorize all shortcuts at once
   - Master the basics first: movement, editing, saving
   - Then gradually learn more advanced features

4. **Hints and Help**
   - LazyVim shows current mode at the bottom
   - Command panel shows descriptions for each operation
   - Press `Space + h + k` to view all shortcuts

## Summary

Switching from Word to LazyVim does take time to adjust, but once you master these basic concepts and operations, you'll discover its power. Remember, the most important thing during this process is to stay patient and not expect to master everything at once.

As you use it more, you'll find that LazyVim's features can greatly improve your text editing efficiency. This is especially true when you need to handle multiple files simultaneously or navigate quickly within files.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter problems while using LazyVim:

1. **Keys Not Responding?**
   - First check if you're in the correct mode (Normal mode, Insert mode, etc.)
   - Check if there are any hints in the bottom status bar

2. **Don't Know What You Pressed?**
   - Press `u` to undo the last operation
   - Press `Ctrl + r` to redo undone operations

3. **Want to Exit but Don't Know How?**
   - Press `Space + q + q` to exit all files
   - Or `Space + b + d` to close the current file

I hope this guide helps you transition to LazyVim more smoothly. Remember, everyone starts as a beginner - maintain patience and curiosity, and you'll definitely master this powerful tool!
